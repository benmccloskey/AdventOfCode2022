As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).\n\nThe Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.\n\nFor example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:\n\n1000\n2000\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n6000\n\n7000\n8000\n9000\n\n10000\nThis list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:\n\nThe first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.\nThe second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.\nThe third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.\nThe fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.\nThe fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.\nIn case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).\n\nFind the Elf carrying the most Calories.
